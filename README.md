# TFM- Reputation Based Consensus

This repository holds the code used for the development of a Reputation Based Consensus algorithm for the final thesis in the Master degree on Industrial Engineering.

The goal of this projects is to test a newly developed algorithm against know consensus in the literature and see the improvement we observe. In particular, this algorithm sets a reputation parameter to each participant of the network and will be updated during the process of consensus depending on their behavior. If the participant follows the rules set for consensus the reputation will stay high, making it a trustworthy agent. If not, reputation will drop and the rest of the network will not take into account the value reported for consensus.

With this we prevent malicious agent to alter the result of the consensus and always reach an agreement.
